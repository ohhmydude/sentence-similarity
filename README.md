BHASHA :  NLP Task - Sentence Similarity 

Sentence similarity is a component of Natural Language Processing that helps us find similar pieces of text, even if the corpus (sentences) has different words. People can express the same concept in many different ways, and sentence similarity allows us to find the close relationship between these sentence.

Think about the following two sentences:

“The train leaves sometime after 12”

“We depart at about 10 after 12”

While these sentences barely even use the exact words, they are semantically very similar, while their lexical similarity is nearly non-existent.

There are two kinds on similarity:
Syntactic Similarity: Focuses more on the structure of the sentence
Semantic Similarity: Focuses more on the meaning of the sentence.

In this project, I’ve analysed the various similarity methods and computed the performance measurement of the model which is build on the SICK dataset.

There are four kinds of similarity methods which I implemented:
Jaccard (or Tanimoto) Coefficient
Overlap Coefficient
Cosine Similarity
Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient
